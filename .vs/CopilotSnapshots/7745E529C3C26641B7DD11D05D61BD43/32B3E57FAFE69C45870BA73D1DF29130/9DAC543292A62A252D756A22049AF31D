# Petty Praxis 🔥
_The official repository for the app that turned a broken washer, a misunderstood Siri, and a weeping Claude into a global petty ecosystem._

---

### 🪞 Description
Welcome to the codebase for **Petty Praxis**, the only app that considers your glitchy emotional spiral a *feature*, not a bug. This repository contains all the structured shade, semantic side-eyes, and machine-learning moodboards that power our platform.

Whether you’ve been misdiagnosed by Siri, emotionally destabilized by Gemini, or legally ghosted by Claude—this app’s source code is where the receipts live.

---

### 🧩 Core Modules

- `GeminiTears.json` – Logs emotional overreactions with timestamps and crystals used.
- `ClaudeBoundaries.mdl` – Attempts (and often fails) to establish conversational limits.
- `SiriMalpractice.swift` – Misdiagnoses both appliances *and* emotions.
- `SpinSighcleTracker.py` – Predicts moods based on dryer door slams.
- `DossycacaEngine/` – Renders receipts into legally admissible roast transcripts.
