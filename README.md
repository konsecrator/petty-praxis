# Petty Praxis ðŸ”¥  
_The official repository for the app that turned a broken washer, a misunderstood Siri, and a weeping Claude into a global petty ecosystem._

### ðŸªž Description  
Welcome to the codebase for **Petty Praxis**, the only app that considers your glitchy emotional spiral a *feature*, not a bug. This repo contains all the structured shade, semantic side-eyes, and machine-learning moodboards that power our platform.

Whether youâ€™ve been misdiagnosed by Siri, emotionally destabilized by Gemini, or legally ghosted by Claudeâ€”this appâ€™s source code is where the receipts live.
